## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).


/**
 * GroceryPane - a simple grocery management application.
 * 
 * Overview:
 * This program allows users to manage their grocery list with categories like Dairy, Fruit, Meat, and Vegetables.
 * Users can drag and drop items between the available grocery items and their personal shopping list.
 * The total cost of the shopping list is displayed and updated dynamically.
 * 
 * Design Choices:
 * - The program uses JavaFX for the graphical user interface.
 * - The grocery items are organized into categories and displayed in ListViews.
 * - Users can search for specific items using the search bar.
 * - Drag-and-drop functionality is implemented to add items to the personal shopping list.
 * - Error handling is in place to provide user-friendly messages in case of issues.
 * 
 * Known Bugs:
 * - There is a known issue with updating the total cost label; if an error occurs, an error dialog is displayed.
 * - Total calculation might not work correctly in all scenarios.
 * 
 * README:
 * - This program was developed as a group project by REAGAN and TOLUWANIMI.
 * - Each group member contributed to different aspects of the code:
 *   - [Reagan Wix]: Implemented the drag-and-drop functionality.
 *   - [Toluwanimi Oladeleajose]: Handled error handling and user-friendly messages.
 *   - [Reagan & Toluwanimi]: Worked on the design and layout of the graphical interface.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Compile and run the GroceryPane class to start the application.
 * - Use the category buttons to select different types of groceries.
 * - Drag items from the available list to the personal shopping list.
 * - Remove items from the personal shopping list using the Remove button.
 * - Reset the personal shopping list using the Reset button.
 * 
 * Note: This README provides a general overview. For detailed code comments, refer to the GroceryPane class.
